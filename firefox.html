    <h2><a name="Firefox">A history of Firefox</a></h2>

    <p>The project which became Firefox started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m/b (or
        mozilla/browser). After it had been sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in September
        2002
        under the name Phoenix.</p>

        23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking enabled by
        default to
        defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range form control attribute in HTML5, dropping
        support for the blink HTML element as well as text-decoration:blink CSS element, the restriction to have to
        "switch
        to a different search provider across the entire browser," and a global browser console, a new network monitor
        among
        other things.
